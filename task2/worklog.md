### Coding

- Battled a bit with the Key event API. Insisting on trying to make the KeyEvent handler work. Solution was to use the proper event: KeyUp, this is the precise event where the logic should check for input and convert if valid
- int64 vs int was an interesting experience

### Issues

- None

### Timing

- About 2h. A lot due to a small mistake missing pointers, another trying to figure the fyne API on key events.
