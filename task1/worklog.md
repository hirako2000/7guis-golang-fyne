### Set up

- mod init
- install [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne)

### Coding

- Use intro doc to set up a GUI window
- Look up integer delcaration and convertion to string
- Look up text field creation
- Look up layout to use a grid system for horizontal layout
- Set button, increment and display within event function

### Issues

- The GUI is not snappy. Something to do with the magical event handler?

### Timing

- About 45 minutes.
