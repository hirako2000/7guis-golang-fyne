### Coding

- Ticker from native golang time works like a charm, easy interface, and go routine makes concurrency simple to write I - Still shocked by the data formats so many ways to format float64.
- Resorting to global state again. Not sure this is appropriate, but here again it makes the logic simple to implement
- The _ declaration here again.
- Fyn's layout system really lacks. It doesn't seem possible to adjust the coolum size of a Grid layout.

### Issues

- None.

### Timing

- About 3h.
